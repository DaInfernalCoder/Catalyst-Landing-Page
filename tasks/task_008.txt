# Task ID: 8
# Title: Integrate Supabase with Signup Form
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Connect the signup form to Supabase for data storage and implement form submission logic.
# Details:
1. Create a Next.js API route for form submission
2. Initialize Supabase client with environment variables
3. Implement form submission handler that sends data to the API route
4. Add data validation on the server side
5. Store valid submissions in the Supabase 'registrations' table
6. Implement error handling and success feedback
7. Add appropriate loading states during submission

# Test Strategy:
Test the full submission flow with valid and invalid data. Verify data is correctly stored in Supabase. Test error handling by simulating network failures and validation errors.

# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Scroll-to-Skip Functionality for GSAP Preloader Animation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the preloader component to allow users to scroll to skip or speed up the animation instead of waiting for it to complete naturally.
# Details:
Currently, users must wait 3+ seconds for the GSAP preloader animation to complete before accessing the main content. This task involves modifying the preloader component to respond to scroll events (mouse wheel, touch scroll, or any scroll gesture) by either accelerating or immediately completing the animation.

Implementation requirements:
1. Add event listeners for scroll events (wheel, touchmove, etc.) while the preloader is active
2. When a scroll event is detected, implement one of these approaches:
   a. Progress-based: Map scroll intensity to animation progress (more scrolling = faster progression)
   b. Skip-based: Any scroll action immediately completes the animation
3. Ensure the GSAP timeline is properly controlled - either by setting its progress property or by calling the .progress() method with appropriate values
4. Add a subtle visual indicator that informs users they can scroll to skip (e.g., a small "Scroll to skip" text or icon)
5. Maintain the visual quality of the animation even when accelerated
6. Ensure smooth transition to the main content when the animation is skipped
7. Clean up all event listeners once the preloader is dismissed

The implementation should preserve the aesthetic appeal of the original animation while giving users more control over their experience.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the functional and user experience aspects of this enhancement:

1. Functional testing:
   - Verify scroll events are properly detected during the preloader animation
   - Confirm the animation accelerates or skips based on scroll input
   - Test with different input methods: mouse wheel, trackpad gestures, touch scrolling on mobile devices
   - Ensure event listeners are properly removed after the preloader completes
   - Check that the animation still completes normally if no scrolling occurs

2. User experience testing:
   - Measure and compare load times with and without scroll interaction
   - Test with various scroll intensities to ensure the response feels natural
   - Verify the visual indicator for scrolling is noticeable but not distracting
   - Test on different devices and browsers to ensure consistent behavior
   - Conduct A/B testing with users to gather feedback on the enhanced experience
   - Verify that users with accessibility needs can still navigate effectively

3. Performance testing:
   - Ensure the scroll event handling doesn't cause performance issues
   - Verify that rapid scrolling doesn't break the animation or cause visual glitches
   - Check memory usage to confirm no leaks from event listeners

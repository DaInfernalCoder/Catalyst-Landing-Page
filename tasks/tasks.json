Reduce heading sizes proportionally for mobile screens while maintaining hierarchy. Implement proper text contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text). Optimize content spacing using consistent vertical rhythm with rem units. Ensure adequate white space between content blocks for touch interaction.

Implement native lazy loading with `loading=\"lazy\"` attribute and Intersection Observer API fallback for older browsers. Optimize image compression and use next-gen formats (WebP, AVIF) with fallbacks. Set proper sizes attribute based on layout: `sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw\"`. Implement CSS aspect-ratio property to prevent layout shift during image loading. Add proper alt text for accessibility. Use CSS object-fit for responsive image scaling within containers.

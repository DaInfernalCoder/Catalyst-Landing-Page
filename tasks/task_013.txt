# Task ID: 13
# Title: Update Navigation Bar for Catalyst Entrepreneurship Club Website
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Redesign and implement a functional, responsive navigation bar that aligns with the Catalyst Entrepreneurship Club branding, replacing login/get started buttons with a 'Join Us' button linking to the waitlist/signup section.
# Details:
The navigation bar should be updated with the following specifications:

1. Remove the existing 'Login' and 'Get Started' buttons completely from the navigation
2. Add a prominent 'Join Us' button that links to the waitlist/signup section of the page
3. Ensure the navigation includes links to key sections: 'About', 'Program', and 'Join Us' at minimum
4. Implement smooth scrolling behavior when navigation links are clicked (use CSS scroll-behavior: smooth or a JavaScript solution)
5. Make the navigation fully responsive:
   - On desktop: Standard horizontal navigation with appropriate spacing
   - On mobile: Implement a hamburger menu that expands/collapses
6. Style the navigation to match the Catalyst Entrepreneurship Club's color scheme and design language
7. Ensure the active/current section is visually indicated in the navigation
8. Add appropriate hover states for all navigation elements
9. Ensure the navigation remains accessible with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
10. The navigation should remain fixed at the top of the viewport during scrolling

Use semantic HTML elements (<nav>, <ul>, <li>) for the navigation structure. Implement the mobile menu toggle using JavaScript with appropriate event listeners.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functionality and appearance across devices:

1. Visual Inspection:
   - Verify the navigation matches the Catalyst Entrepreneurship Club branding
   - Confirm 'Login' and 'Get Started' buttons are removed
   - Verify 'Join Us' button is prominently displayed
   - Check that all required navigation links are present

2. Functionality Testing:
   - Click each navigation link to verify smooth scrolling to the correct section
   - Test the 'Join Us' button navigates correctly to the waitlist/signup section
   - Verify the active section is properly highlighted in the navigation

3. Responsive Testing:
   - Test on multiple screen sizes (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px widths)
   - Verify hamburger menu appears on mobile and functions correctly
   - Check that all navigation elements are properly sized and spaced at all breakpoints

4. Accessibility Testing:
   - Verify navigation is keyboard accessible (can tab through all items)
   - Check that proper ARIA attributes are implemented
   - Test with a screen reader to ensure all navigation elements are properly announced
   - Verify color contrast meets WCAG AA standards

5. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Verify functionality and appearance in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

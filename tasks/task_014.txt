# Task ID: 14
# Title: Redesign and Implement Functional Footer for Catalyst Entrepreneurship Club
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the website footer to be more relevant for Catalyst Entrepreneurship Club by removing unnecessary sections, implementing a functional language selector, and ensuring responsive design.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive update to the footer component:

1. Remove the QR code section entirely from the footer component
2. Implement a functional language selector with proper dropdown menu:
   - Use appropriate dropdown component that works on all devices
   - Ensure language selection persists across page navigation
   - Include at least English and any other relevant languages
3. Restructure the footer links:
   - Keep only the 'Get Started' section
   - Update the 'Start a Chapter' link to direct to the waitlist page
   - Remove the 'Resources' and 'Support' sections completely
4. Rebalance the footer layout after removing sections:
   - Adjust spacing and alignment for visual balance
   - Ensure the footer maintains proper width constraints
   - Consider using flexbox or grid for responsive layout
5. Ensure the footer is fully responsive:
   - Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
   - Implement appropriate breakpoints for different screen sizes
   - Verify text remains readable and links are easily clickable on all devices

Use the existing design system for styling to maintain consistency with the rest of the site.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functionality and appearance:

1. Visual inspection:
   - Verify QR code section is completely removed
   - Confirm footer layout is balanced and visually appealing
   - Check that only the 'Get Started' section remains with appropriate links

2. Functional testing:
   - Test language selector dropdown on desktop and mobile devices
   - Verify language selection works and persists across page navigation
   - Confirm 'Start a Chapter' link correctly directs to the waitlist page

3. Responsive testing:
   - Test on multiple devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) and browsers
   - Verify at standard breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
   - Ensure no horizontal scrolling occurs at any viewport width
   - Check that touch targets are appropriately sized on mobile (at least 44x44px)

4. Accessibility testing:
   - Verify footer is navigable via keyboard
   - Test with screen readers to ensure all elements are properly announced
   - Check color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
   - Verify language selector is accessible via keyboard and screen readers

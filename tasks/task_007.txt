# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Signup Form Component
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace the JoinSection testimonial carousel with a signup form for student registration.
# Details:
1. Transform src/components/UI/JoinSection/ from testimonial carousel to signup form
2. Create form fields for: name, email, school/university, year of study, and area of interest
3. Implement form validation using client-side validation with smooth error state animations
4. Style the form using Styled Components to match the site's design system:
   - Maintain emerald background (#48d64c)
   - Use SF Pro Display font family with consistent sizing
   - Follow layout patterns (90% width, max-width 1440px, centered)
   - Implement responsive design (mobile-first with 768px breakpoint)
5. Implement Framer Motion animations following existing patterns:
   - Use MaskText for header text reveal animations
   - Apply useInView hook for viewport-triggered animations
   - Implement staggered input field animations (0.1s delays)
   - Add RevealCover-style animations for form container
   - Create AnimatedLink-style hover effects for submit button
6. Ensure the form is fully responsive following existing mobile/desktop patterns
7. Implement loading states (1-1.4s durations), success state animations, and error handling with consistent easing patterns

# Test Strategy:
1. Test form validation with various inputs including edge cases
2. Verify responsive behavior across different screen sizes (especially at 768px breakpoint)
3. Check that animations work correctly during form submission, success states, and error states
4. Verify animation timing and easing matches existing patterns
5. Test accessibility of form elements and animations
6. Ensure visual consistency with the existing design system
7. Test form submission flow with mock API responses

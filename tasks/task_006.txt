# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the Supabase database schema for storing student registration information.
# Details:
1. Create a new 'registrations' table in Supabase with the following fields:
   - id (uuid, primary key)
   - created_at (timestamp with timezone)
   - name (text, not null)
   - email (text, not null)
   - school (text, not null)
   - message (text)
2. Set up appropriate validation rules and indexes
3. Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies for secure access

# Test Strategy:
Test the database schema by manually inserting and retrieving test records. Verify all fields store data correctly and that validation rules work as expected.
